# Welcome

This project is small back-up for my talk at [Java2Days conference](https://2018.java2days.com/) in Sofia, November 2018.
The goal of the talk is to:
+ give the attendees some fundamental Kafka knowledge.
+ show a very minimalistic examples with the Kafka API-s.
+ demonstrate some real world examples. 

# Contents

The project consists of:

+ A demo usage of the standard Kafka JAVA [Producer](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerapi) and [Consumer](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerapi) API-s.
+ A demo of super simplified usage of the [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#streamsapi) API.
+ A demo of [Sping Kafka](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka).

Prerequisites if you want to use the project:

+ A running Kafka installation (details below)
+ Knowledge of Kafka theory.
